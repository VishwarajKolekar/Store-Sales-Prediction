# Store Sales Prediction

### Problem Statement
Nowadays, shopping malls and Big Marts keep track of individual item sales data in
order to forecast future client demand and adjust inventory management. In a data
warehouse, these data stores hold a significant amount of consumer information and
particular item details. By mining the data store from the data warehouse, more
anomalies and common patterns can be discovered.

# Objective

We have to build a solution that should able to predict the sales of the
different stores of Big Mart according to the provided dataset.
